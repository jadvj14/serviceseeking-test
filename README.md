# Test Submission
1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone your forked repo.
3. Write your solution locally.
4. Push to your forked repo.
5. When the code is completed, submit a pull request against our Service Seeking's version.
6. We will review your code and will get in touch with you after that.


## Challenge:
1. Use RSpec to specify Todo::Create (app/concept/todo/create.rb). The spec file has already been created for you.
2. Refactor Todo::Create to your heart's desire. We require that you make use of Trailblazer contracts though.
3. If you have extra time, beautify the UI a little bit.
